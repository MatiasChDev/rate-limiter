# Description

Showcase of different API rate limiter implementations. All methods are implemented as middleware on the server-side for a simple API made with FastAPI for the purpose of this showcase. The project is meant to be deployed in a k8s cluster, but I will also add instructions to run locally using docker compose.

# Run locally
